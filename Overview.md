# Network Model Overview

## Purpose

This model simulates how human social networks evolve and degrade as communication technologies amplify reach beyond our cognitive capacity. It demonstrates the transition from oral culture through print, broadcast, internet, and algorithmic media, showing how each technology introduces new stresses on our Paleolithic brains.

## Core Thesis

**Dunbar's limit** (~150 meaningful relationships) represents a fundamental cognitive constraint based on mammalian brain size and social processing capacity. This limit worked well for oral cultures where reach was naturally bounded by face-to-face interaction. However, successive communication technologies have progressively exceeded this limit, creating cognitive overload, trust collapse, and network fragmentation.

**Cybernetic foundation**: Following Gregory Bateson's work, we understand social relationships as **cybernetic circuits** - feedback loops that regulate behavior through mutual influence. Dunbar's limit exists because maintaining these regulatory circuits requires cognitive resources. When technology enables connections beyond our capacity, these feedback loops fail, homeostasis breaks down, and pathological adaptations emerge (schismogenesis, double binds, learning to maximize engagement rather than meaning).

## Key Concepts

### 1. Cognitive Capacity as Fixed Resource

Each node (person) has:
- **Cognitive capacity**: ~150 units (Dunbar's limit)
- **Connection types** that consume capacity differently
- **Cognitive load**: current usage / total capacity
- **Trust coherence**: ability to evaluate information sources
- **Information diet**: mix of content types consumed

**Critical insight**: Technology makes parasocial connections feel "free" but they still drain cognitive resources, leading to unintentional overload.

### 2. Dunbar's Layers

Relationships organize into concentric circles based on intimacy and time investment:

| Layer | Count | Type | Cognitive Cost per Connection |
|-------|-------|------|------------------------------|
| 1.5 | 1-2 | Intimates (romantic partner) | 20 units |
| 5 | 5 | Shoulders-to-cry-on friends | 8 units |
| 15 | 15 | Core social partners | 3 units |
| 50 | 50 | Big weekend barbecue people | 1 unit |
| 150 | 150 | Wedding/funeral attendees | 0.5 units |
| 500 | 500 | Acquaintances | 0.1 units |
| 1500 | 1500 | Known names | 0.05 units |
| 5000 | 5000 | Recognized faces | 0.01 units |

**The 150 boundary** marks the limit of stable, meaningful relationships where reciprocal trust can be maintained.

### 3. Connection Types

#### Embodied Connections (Warm)
- Face-to-face, reciprocal relationships
- High trust, high context
- Properly accounted cognitive cost
- Natural limit at ~150
- **Visual**: Warm colors (red/orange)

#### Text-Mediated Connections (Warm-Cool Gradient)
- Print-based relationships (author → reader)
- One-way but not purely parasocial
- Intermediate trust (institutional)
- Manageable cognitive load
- **Visual**: Orange to yellow gradient

#### Broadcast Connections (Cool)
- One-to-many, asymmetric
- Parasocial bonds (one side feels connected)
- Low trust, no context
- Hidden cognitive cost
- **Visual**: Cool blue

#### Internet/Social Media Connections (Cool, Chaotic)
- Many-to-many but still asymmetric
- Parasocial at scale
- Algorithmic amplification
- Severe hidden cognitive cost
- **Visual**: Light blue, thin, numerous

#### Algorithmic Connections (Cold, Toxic)
- Algorithmically injected, not chosen
- No relationship, just engagement optimization
- Trust collapse
- Maximum cognitive drain
- **Visual**: Gray, pulsing, chaotic

### 4. Content Types & Engagement

Content varies by emotional intensity and algorithmic amplification:

| Type | Engagement | Algorithm Boost | Trust Cost | Cognitive Load |
|------|-----------|----------------|------------|----------------|
| Neutral | 0.1-0.3 | None | Low | Low |
| Inflammatory | 0.5-0.7 | Moderate | Medium | Medium |
| Ragebait | 0.7-0.9 | High | High | High |
| Tribal/Us-vs-Them | 0.9-1.0 | Maximum | Severe | Severe |

**The algorithmic feedback loop:**
1. High-engagement content spreads further
2. Emotional intensity correlates with engagement
3. Creators learn to optimize for rage/tribalism
4. Moderate voices get buried
5. Information environment becomes toxic

### 5. Technology Stratification

Not everyone has access to the same technologies simultaneously:

| Era | Literacy/Access Rate | Creator Capability | Max Reach |
|-----|---------------------|-------------------|-----------|
| Oral (pre-1450) | N/A | Everyone | ~150 (Dunbar) |
| Early Print (1450-1700) | 10-20% | 0.1% | ~10,000 |
| Mass Print (1800-1900) | 60-80% | 1-5% | ~100,000 |
| Broadcast (1920-1990) | 90% access | 0.01% | ~millions |
| Internet (1990-2010) | 50-70% | 2-5% | ~millions |
| Social Media (2010-2020) | 70-85% | 10-40% | ~millions |
| Algorithmic (2020+) | 85%+ | 50%+ participate | ~billions |

**Key insight**: The gap between access and creation capability creates power asymmetries. Later, when everyone can create, algorithmic gatekeepers replace human ones.

### 6. Historical Phases

## Cybernetic Framework (Gregory Bateson)

The model incorporates Bateson's cybernetic theory to explain **why** networks break down beyond Dunbar's limit, not just **that** they do.

### Relationships as Cybernetic Circuits

**True relationships are feedback loops**, not just connections:
- **Embodied relationships**: Bidirectional feedback (you affect me, I affect you, mutual regulation)
- **Parasocial connections**: Unidirectional (you affect me, but I don't affect you, no regulation possible)

Dunbar's limit exists because maintaining cybernetic circuits requires cognitive resources. Parasocial connections feel "free" but still consume capacity without providing regulatory benefit.

### Homeostasis and System Boundaries

Living systems maintain critical variables within viable ranges through **negative feedback loops**. Dunbar's limit (~150) is the **homeostatic boundary** for human social cognition:

- **Within range**: Regulatory circuits function, trust maintained, relationships stable
- **Beyond threshold**: Regulatory capacity fails, system breaks down

**Key insight**: Cognitive overload isn't just "feeling overwhelmed" - it's the literal failure of homeostatic regulation.

### Three Types of Feedback Loops

#### Negative Feedback (Stabilizing)
- **Example**: Social disapproval → behavior change → approval restored
- **Characteristic of**: Oral cultures, face-to-face accountability
- **Effect**: Maintains equilibrium, prevents runaway behavior
- **In the model**: Face-to-face accountability loops, community reputation systems

#### Positive Feedback (Amplifying, Runaway)
- **Example**: Inflammatory post → engagement → more inflammatory posts → escalation
- **Characteristic of**: Algorithmic systems, engagement optimization
- **Effect**: Creates instability, accelerates extremism
- **In the model**: Engagement optimization loops, schismogenesis acceleration

#### Blocked Feedback (Pathological)
- **Example**: Want to quit social media → but all friends are there → stuck
- **Characteristic of**: Network effects traps, double binds
- **Effect**: Produces learned helplessness, chronic stress
- **In the model**: Exit barrier loops, contradictory injunctions with no escape

### Learning Levels (Logical Types)

Bateson distinguished between different **logical types** of learning:

**Learning 0**: Fixed response, no change

**Learning I**: Context-specific learning
- "This behavior gets rewarded in this context"
- Behavior changes, but character doesn't

**Learning II**: Deutero-learning (learning to learn)
- "I've learned what kinds of behaviors get rewarded"
- **Character structure changes** - becomes a "habit of mind"
- Very difficult to unlearn
- **Critical**: When creators learn "inflammatory content always works," this is Level II - a permanent character transformation into an "engagement maximizer"

**Learning III**: Learning about Learning II (rare)
- Awareness of the meta-pattern, seeing you're trapped
- Either: Breakdown (pathological adaptation) or breakthrough (escape)
- Requires extreme stress + some algorithm awareness

### Schismogenesis (Runaway Escalation)

Bateson formalized schismogenesis in *Naven* (1936) using **coupled differential equations** that model mutual influence between parties. The model implements these using Euler method numerical integration.

**Symmetrical schismogenesis**: "If you do X, I'll do X+1"
```
dX/dt = k₁ · Y
dY/dt = k₂ · X
```
- **X, Y**: Behavior intensity of each party (e.g., inflammatory rhetoric level)
- **k₁, k₂**: Coupling constants (how much each party drives the other's rate of change)
- **Solution**: If k₁·k₂ > 0, creates exponential runaway with growth rate √(k₁·k₂)
- Example: Tribal conflict online (each side escalates in response)
- No stable equilibrium, communication eventually becomes impossible
- Algorithms accelerate this by increasing coupling constants (k₁, k₂ proportional to algorithmic amplification)

**Complementary schismogenesis**: "If you dominate, I'll submit more"
```
dX/dt = k₁ · Y
dY/dt = -k₂ · X
```
- **X**: Dominance behavior (e.g., influencer prominence)
- **Y**: Submission behavior (e.g., follower autonomy, 1 = autonomous, 0 = captured)
- **Note**: k₂ applied with negative sign creates differentiation rather than matching
- Example: Influencer/follower parasocial dynamics
- Increasing differentiation between roles
- Can be stable or runaway depending on coupling strength

### Double Binds

A **double bind** requires:
1. Two or more people in an intense relationship
2. Repeated experience (chronic, not one-time)
3. Primary negative injunction: "Don't do X or punishment"
4. Secondary injunction contradicting the first
5. Tertiary injunction preventing escape
6. Prohibition of meta-communication about the contradiction

**Result**: Pathological adaptation (anxiety, paralysis, learned helplessness, dissociation)

**Example in social media**:
- Primary: "You need close relationships" (evolutionary requirement)
- Secondary: "To stay connected, you must use social media with hundreds" (social norm)
- Tertiary: "You can't leave, everyone is there" (network effects)
- No meta-communication: The contradiction is invisible/undiscussable

**Mathematical Model of Stress Dynamics**:

While the double bind itself is a structural/logical constraint, the model implements stress accumulation dynamics:

**Stress Accumulation**:
```
dS/dt = α · E · B - β · R
```
- **S**: Stress level (0 to 1, pathological adaptation at S > 0.9)
- **E**: Escape attempt rate (how often trying to leave)
- **B**: Blocking strength (network effects trap strength)
- **R**: Regulatory capacity (ability to cope)
- **α, β**: Constants (stress accumulation and relief rates)

**Regulatory Capacity Degradation**:
```
dR/dt = -γ · S · (1 - H)
```
- **R**: Regulatory capacity (starts at 1.0)
- **S**: Current stress level
- **H**: Homeostatic health (0 if overloaded, 1 if within range)
- **γ**: Degradation constant

This creates a **runaway degradation loop**: High stress → capacity degrades → less stress relief → higher stress → [loop continues]

**Phase Transition**: When stress crosses threshold (S > 0.9), the system undergoes an irreversible phase transition to one of four pathological adaptations: anxiety (40%), learned helplessness (30%), dissociation (20%), or paralysis (10%).

### Information vs. Noise

**Bateson's definition**: Information is "a difference that makes a difference"

- **Information**: Novel, challenges understanding, enables action, comes from trusted source
- **Redundancy**: Confirms what you already know (echo chamber)
- **Noise**: High engagement, low meaning (ragebait = anti-information)

**In the model**:
- Oral networks: High information/noise ratio (trusted, novel, relevant)
- Print networks: Medium ratio (institutional trust, slower)
- Algorithmic networks: Low ratio (engagement ≠ information value)

### How Cybernetic Concepts Interact

```
Homeostatic Capacity (Within Dunbar's Limit)
       ↓
Feedback Loops Function (Negative feedback regulates)
       ↓
Healthy Learning (Level 0-I, context-appropriate)
       ↓
System Stable, High Information Quality
```

**But when Technology Exceeds Capacity:**

```
Homeostatic Breakdown (Beyond Dunbar's Limit)
       ↓
Feedback Loops Fail (Negative loops blocked, positive loops dominate)
       ↓
Pathological Learning (Level II-III, character transformation)
       ↓
Schismogenesis (Tribal escalation, communication breakdown)
       ↓
Double Binds Emerge (Trapped, can't leave)
       ↓
Information → Noise (Can't evaluate sources)
       ↓
System Collapse
```

**Mathematical Implementation**: The model formalizes these cybernetic dynamics using Bateson's original differential equations for schismogenesis (coupled equations modeling mutual escalation) and stress dynamics for double binds (modeling stress accumulation and regulatory degradation). These are implemented using Euler method numerical integration with discrete time steps. See [[Model/Algorithm]] for complete mathematical specification.

## The Oral Culture Connection

### Agonistic Dynamics

**In oral cultures:**
- Verbal combat, insult games, boasting
- Bounded by face-to-face accountability
- Social costs for excess
- Community regulation

**In algorithmic culture:**
- Same tribal instincts activated
- No face-to-face accountability
- Anonymous/distant combatants
- Algorithms reward extremism
- No social cost, only engagement rewards

### The Amygdala Hijack

Inflammatory content triggers ancient threat-detection systems:
- Cognitive capacity temporarily reduced (stress response)
- Trust evaluation ability impaired (threat mode)
- Embodied connections neglected (consumed by online conflict)
- Addiction-like patterns emerge (doom scrolling)
- **Result**: We're simultaneously overloaded AND emotionally hijacked

## Model Goals

### What We Want to Show

1. **Cognitive overload is structural, not personal failure**
   - Our brains have fixed capacity
   - Technology exceeds that capacity
   - Overload is inevitable beyond certain thresholds

2. **The progression from oral to algorithmic**
   - Each technology adds stress
   - Print was manageable
   - Internet exceeded capacity
   - Algorithms weaponize our vulnerabilities

3. **Trust collapse as emergent property**
   - Not individual gullibility
   - System-level breakdown
   - Result of cognitive overload + engagement optimization

4. **Embodied networks as foundation**
   - Healthy oral networks still exist (offline populations)
   - These provide stability and resilience
   - Loss of embodied connections is loss of anchor

5. **The illusion of connection**
   - Parasocial bonds feel like relationships
   - But don't provide actual support
   - Quantity replaces quality
   - Loneliness amid "connection"

### Possible Interventions to Model

From a cybernetic perspective, interventions must **restore functional feedback loops** and **prevent pathological learning**:

1. **Awareness of cognitive cost**
   - What if people knew parasocial connections weren't "free"?
   - Would behavior change?
   - **Cybernetic effect**: Enables conscious regulation before overload

2. **Algorithm de-optimization**
   - Remove engagement maximization
   - Chronological feeds
   - No amplification of inflammatory content
   - **Cybernetic effect**: Eliminates positive feedback loops, restores negative feedback

3. **Digital sabbath / intentional disconnection**
   - Periodic offline time
   - Allow embodied connections to recover
   - **Cybernetic effect**: Restores homeostatic balance, rebuilds regulatory capacity

4. **Literacy about manipulation**
   - Teach recognition of ragebait
   - Show algorithmic mechanics
   - Build resistance
   - **Cybernetic effect**: Enables Learning III (awareness of the trap), provides escape route from double binds

5. **Community-scale networks**
   - Return to Dunbar-sized online communities
   - No viral amplification
   - Human-scale moderation
   - **Cybernetic effect**: Maintains system within homeostatic boundaries, preserves functional feedback loops

6. **De-schismogenesis protocols**
   - Prevent tribal sorting algorithms
   - Force cross-tribal exposure (with safety)
   - Reward bridge-building behavior
   - **Cybernetic effect**: Interrupts symmetrical escalation, maintains communication capacity

7. **Escape route design**
   - Make leaving social media viable (export friends)
   - Reduce network effects lock-in
   - Alternative connection infrastructure
   - **Cybernetic effect**: Eliminates double bind tertiary injunction, restores agency

## Visualization Goals

### Network States
- Show all 6 historical phases
- Show progression from one to the next, but also transition cost of jumping between phases (ie, sudden introduction of new capabilities)
- Animate transitions in the network

### Visual Encoding
- **Node color**: Cognitive load (green → yellow → red)
- **Node size**: Inversely proportional to Dunbar layer
- **Edge color**: Connection type (warm → cool)
- **Edge thickness**: Relationship strength
- **Edge opacity**: Trust level
- **Network clustering**: Tribal fragmentation visible

### Information Flow Animation
- Show how content spreads differently through:
  - Embodied networks (slow, transforming, trusted)
  - Print networks (medium speed, fixed, institutional trust)
  - Broadcast networks (fast, identical, parasocial)
  - Internet networks (instant, chaotic, low trust)
  - Algorithmic networks (instant, optimized for engagement, toxic)

### Interactive Elements
- Adjust population composition (literacy rates, access)
- Adjust algorithm parameters (engagement weighting)
- Adjust content mix (neutral vs inflammatory)
